ALTERNATIVE MECHANICAL PARTS (Printed Parts, V2.2)

1. INTRODUCTION

The contents of this release include alternatives to the basic framing and mechanical components sets used in the FLEX.
These parts are intended to replace required parts in the basic build; additional/optional parts are contained in a separate release.
All contents are intended to be 3D-printed; some replace basic printed parts while others replace retail/manufactured parts used in the FLEX.



2. CONTENTS

MAX Parts
The MAX parts include alternatives to (02)X-Base-Left, (03)X-Base-Right, and (10) Y-Carriage-Upper that allow additional travel within the standard frame size.
     a. (02)X-Base-Left-MAX and (03)X-Base-Right-MAX are 50mm 'shorter', allowing use of 50mm longer X-shafts and ballscrew assemblies in the standard frame size.
     [In order to gain the extra travel, users must use 50mm longer X-shafts and ballscrews in conjunction with these MAX parts)
     [608 bearing recesses are inteference fit but may require a zip-tie depending on printed accuracy]
     b. (10)Y-Carriage-Upper-MAX moves the ballscrew mount of the plate towards Y-, allowing ~50mm more travel with the basic Y-shaft and ballscrew configuration.
     [No change to the Y-shafts or ballscrew are required to gain the extra travel, it is taken up from the coupled shaft end]

Printed Corners
The printed corners offer a printed alternative to metal corner plates and gussets.
     a. Corner-Base is a simple, dimensionally identical replacement for two adjacent 60mm triangular corner plates
     b. Corner-Top adds a 'top' plane layer for additional rigidity and squareness, and includes a countersunk M5 mount hole to fix to the X-axis (vertical corner) extrusions
     c. Corner-Base-Fixture uses the same base plane as Corner-Top but adds a countersunk M6 (0.25-0.375") holes to allow bolting the FLEX frame down to a workbench, enclosure frame, or chip collection system

Endstop (ES) Parts
The ES parts include alternatives to (07)X-Motor-Right and (11)Y-Carriage-Lower as well as drop-in mounts to allow installation of a variety of different endstop types at machine limits of X-/Y+/Z+.

Reinforced (RF) Parts
The RF parts include alternatives for printed parts prone to breakage and layer separation by modeling 0.001mm air gaps into parts, tricking slicers into adding additional shell layers.
Parts are designated either RF04 or RF05, referring to the intended nozzle diameter/line width to be used; use of different nozzle diameters in printing will result in failures.
RF04 parts are intended for printing with a 0.4mm nozzle and two shell contours ('shell thickness' 0.8mm).
RF05 parts are intended for printing with a 0.5mm nozzle and two shell contours ('shell thickness' 1.0mm).
Shell/outer layer overlap settings and 'ignore features of ___ size' in slicers may result in failures. Experiment before diving in!

3030 (30) Parts
The 30 parts are re-scaled alternatives to original printed parts allowing construction of the frame using 3030 T-slot extrusion as opposed to 2020.
