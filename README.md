V0.9.1 BETA

This project is a collective effort building upon the DD Ghost Gunner to provide a more accessible CNC solution in the space.

The first iteration project (BETA) goals are:
1. RepRap conformity for sourced and printed parts to assemble a 20-series T-slot extrusion frame
2. BOM not to exceed 300 USD of commercially available parts
3. Scaled design with modular components, readily interchangeable with production model Ghost Gunner

This project remains open source and free to distribute under CC0 1.0 Universal license as conforming with the original, https://ghostgunner.net/ghost-gunner-license/
