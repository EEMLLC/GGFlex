# ghostgunnerflex

The Ghost Gunner FLEX is a hardware iteration of the "Adaptive" design of the Defense Distributed Ghost Gunner project. Ths FLEX maintains the initial design goals and parameters of the Adaptive build but is specifically tailored to facilitate sourcing and assembly by parties in the United States and includes additional quality of life improvements. Specifically;

1. The FLEX swaps the Chinese-sourced, 52mm DC hobby spindle for the cheaper, stronger, and more readily available Harbor Freight/Drill Master 2.4A trim router (https://www.harborfreight.com/14-in-24-Amp-Trim-Router-62659.html) as the stock spindle option
2. The FLEX features a modular tool mount/Z-carriage, allowing relatively quick swaps of toolheads
3. The FLEX includes endstops for automatic, repeatable, and absolute zeroing of axes [UNDER DEVELOPMENT]
4. The FLEX includes alternate mounts for controllers (RAMPS, MKS GEN/DLC, Smoothie, etc.) in addition to the standard CNC Shield [UNDER DEVELOPMENT]
5. The FLEX includes alternate mounts for spindles (Ryobi, Dewalt, Bosch, etc. router spindles) in addition to the HF 2.4A trim and 52mm hobby DC [UNDER DEVELOPMENT]
6. The FLEX includes pallet-type work changing allowing the rapid swap of different tooling jigs for different projects

Longer term development goals and intended iterations of the FLEX include:

1. A lower cost frame option built with SAE hardware and steel EMT conduit replacing the metric and T-slot hardware and extrusion
2. Full RepRap compatibility in adopting a larger build envelop/workspace and ability to swap in an FDM print-head
3. A geared, "mostly printed" 4th axis allowing the machining of more complex parts by simultaneous 4-axis controls
4. Simple, hand-fabricated enclosure panels with vacuum and streamlined cable management
